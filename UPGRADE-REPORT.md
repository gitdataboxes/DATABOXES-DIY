# Assessments

### Desktop/Laptop Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes estimated potential impact (high,med,low) and recommended level of urgency (high,med,low)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on relevant impact and urgency

### Site Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes estimated potential impact (high,med,low) and recommended level of urgency (high,med,low)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on relevant impact and urgency
