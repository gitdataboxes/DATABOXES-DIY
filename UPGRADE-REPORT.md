# Assessments

### Desktop/Laptop Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes level of urgency, potential impact, total and levels of response (1,2,3)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on urgency and relevant impact

### Site Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes level of urgency, potential impact, total and levels of response (1,2,3)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on urgency and relevant impact
