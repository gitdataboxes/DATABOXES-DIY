# Assessments

### Desktop/Laptop Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes estimated potential impact (high,med,low) and recommended level of urgency (high,med,low)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on relevant impact and urgency

- **Component Attributes** - Describes some attribute the component does or does not have
- **YES/NO** - Yes component has this attribute, No component does not have this attribute
- **Impact** - Potential impact to normal operations
- **Urgency** - Recommended time frame for resolving issues

### Site Assessment (May 2024)
- The following table uses a simple YES/NO status check for assessing fundamental "component attributes"
- Each component attribute includes estimated potential impact (high,med,low) and recommended level of urgency (high,med,low)
- The results from this assessment can then be mapped to specific goals to help ensure effective deployment of resources based on relevant impact and urgency
