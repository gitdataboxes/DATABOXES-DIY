IT management reduced to data lifecycles and hardware/software lifecycles

### Primary Goal
Maintain important data across time on easily replaceable hardware/software
### Step 1 - Do an Upgrade Report

- Goals - Map Assessment results to relevant Goals based on Status, Impact and Urgency
- Upgrade Plans - Minimum, Recommended and Maximum Upgrade Plans based on Upgrade Report Assessment and Goals
### Step 2 - Installation
- Ordering hardware and software for installation
- Backups of important existing data
- Site Infrastructure (Internet service quality, site constraints and layout considerations, networking and power configurations)
- On-Site hardware installation
- Remote software installation
### Step 3 - Support - On-Site and Remote Support
- Remote IT Support
- On-Site IT Support
- Disaster Recovery Response
- Software Updates, Repairs, Restorations, Replacements
